# httpxy — Agent Guide

Full-featured HTTP/WebSocket proxy for Node.js. Zero production dependencies. Originally forked from [http-party/node-http-proxy](https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy).

## API

- **`createProxyServer(opts)`** / **`ProxyServer`** — Traditional event-driven proxy server with middleware pipeline
- **`proxyFetch(addr, input, init?)`** — Web-standard `Request`/`Response` interface for proxying individual requests
- **`proxyUpgrade(addr, req, socket, head?, opts?)`** — Standalone WebSocket upgrade proxy without a `ProxyServer` instance

## Source Architecture (`src/`)

### Request flow (HTTP)

```
Client → ProxyServer.web() → web-incoming passes → http.request(target) → target server
Target response → web-outgoing passes → client response
```

### Request flow (WebSocket)

```
Client upgrade → ProxyServer.ws() → ws-incoming passes → http.request(target)
Target upgrade → bidirectional socket pipe
```

### Request flow (proxyFetch)

```
proxyFetch(addr, request) → http.request to addr → Web Response
```

### Request flow (proxyUpgrade)

```
proxyUpgrade(addr, req, socket, head) → http.request to addr → upgrade → bidirectional socket pipe
Returns Promise<Socket> (the upstream proxy socket)
```

### Key design patterns

- **Middleware pipeline**: Passes are functions that run in order; returning `true` halts the chain
- **Event-driven**: `ProxyServer` emits lifecycle events (`start`, `proxyReq`, `proxyRes`, `end`, `error`, `open`, `close`)
- **Extensible middleware**: `server.before(type, passName, fn)` / `server.after(type, passName, fn)` to insert custom passes
- **Flexible targets**: TCP (`host:port`), Unix socket (`socketPath`), or URL string

## Behavioral Notes (Source + Tests)

- `proxy.web()` / `proxy.ws()` return a Promise and can either reject (no `error` listener, request/response error) or resolve after `res.close`.
- Per-call options are merged as `{ ...opts, ...server.options }`, so constructor options override per-call options on key conflicts.
- String `target`/`forward` values are normalized to `URL` objects before middleware execution.
- Missing both `target` and `forward` emits `error` with message `"Must provide a proper URL as target"`.
- Middleware names are often empty strings (passes are wrapped arrow functions). Tests use `before("web", "", ...)` / `after("web", "", ...)`.
- `ProxyServer.close()` is a no-op before `listen()`, and sets internal `_server` to `undefined` after close callback.

### HTTP middleware semantics

- Incoming pass order is fixed: `deleteLength -> timeout -> XHeaders -> stream`.
- `deleteLength` applies to both `DELETE` and `OPTIONS` without content length; it sets `content-length: 0` and removes `transfer-encoding`.
- `proxyReq` event is intentionally skipped when request has `expect` header (`100-continue` advisory coverage).
- `selfHandleResponse: true` skips outgoing passes and auto-pipe; callers must finish the response in `proxyRes`.
- `proxyTimeout` aborts upstream request and surfaces timeout errors (tested as `ECONNRESET`).
- `followRedirects: true | number` enables native redirect following (301/302/303/307/308). `true` = max 5 hops, number = custom max.
- On 301/302/303 redirects, method changes to GET and request body is dropped.
- On 307/308 redirects, original method and body are preserved (body is buffered on first request for replay).
- `proxyRes` event fires only for the final (non-redirect) response; `proxyReq` fires for each request including redirects.
- Sensitive headers (`authorization`, `cookie`) are stripped on cross-origin redirects.
- When `followRedirects` is enabled, the request body is tee'd (written to proxy request and buffered simultaneously) rather than piped.

### WebSocket middleware semantics

- Incoming pass order is fixed: `checkMethodAndHeader -> XHeaders -> stream`.
- WS requests must be `GET` with `upgrade: websocket`; otherwise socket is destroyed and the chain stops.
- `proxyReqWs`, `open`, `close`, and deprecated `proxySocket` events are part of tested flow.
- Upgrade response headers preserve repeated headers like multiple `Set-Cookie` values.

### Outgoing response semantics

- Outgoing pass order is fixed: `removeChunked -> setConnection -> setRedirectHostRewrite -> writeHeaders -> writeStatusCode`.
- Redirect rewrite applies on `201`, `301`, `302`, `303`, `307`, `308` only, and only when `Location` host matches `target.host`.
- `hostRewrite` takes precedence over `autoRewrite`; `protocolRewrite` composes with either.
- Protocol-relative `Location` values (`//host/path`) are preserved as protocol-relative after rewriting (WHATWG `URL` would otherwise absolutize them with the target protocol). Consequently `protocolRewrite` is a no-op for protocol-relative locations — the client resolves the scheme itself. Ported from node-http-proxy#1298.
- Cookie rewriting supports string or mapping config (including wildcard `"*"` and empty string for removal).
- `preserveHeaderKeyCase` uses `rawHeaders` when available.

### URL/path handling invariants

- Path joining does not normalize repeated slashes (`/a/b//c` stays as-is).
- `joinURL()` always returns a usable path and avoids duplicate slash insertion.
- `toProxy: true` preserves absolute URL in outgoing path as `"/" + req.url`.
- `ignorePath` drops request path; with `prependPath: false` the outgoing path becomes `/`.

### `proxyFetch` semantics

- `addr` accepts `http://host:port`, `https://host:port`, `unix:/path.sock`, or object form `{ host, port }` / `{ socketPath }`.
- Both HTTP and HTTPS upstream targets are supported. HTTPS is auto-detected from the `addr` string protocol.
- When `addr` is a URL string with a path (e.g. `http://host:port/api`), the path is prepended to the request path via `joinURL()`.
- Redirect mode defaults to `manual`.
- Streaming request bodies are supported (`ReadableStream`) and set `duplex: "half"`.
- Hop-by-hop response headers `transfer-encoding`, `keep-alive`, `connection` are stripped.
- Response body is `null` for `204` and `304`.
- Network and request-body-stream errors reject the Promise.
- Accepts optional `ProxyFetchOptions` as 4th argument with `timeout`, `xfwd`, `changeOrigin`, `agent`, `followRedirects`, and `ssl`.
- `timeout` sets a deadline on the upstream request; rejects with `"Proxy request timed out"` on expiry.
- `xfwd` adds `x-forwarded-for`, `x-forwarded-port`, `x-forwarded-proto`, `x-forwarded-host` derived from the input URL (not from a socket, since there is no incoming connection). Existing headers are not overwritten.
- `changeOrigin` rewrites the `Host` header to match the resolved target address (host:port for TCP, `localhost` for Unix sockets). Accounts for default ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
- `agent` enables connection pooling/reuse via a custom `http.Agent`. Defaults to `false` (no agent).
- `followRedirects` enables automatic redirect following. `true` = max 5 hops; number = custom max. On 301/302/303 method changes to GET and body is dropped. On 307/308 method and body are preserved (body is buffered). Sensitive headers (`authorization`, `cookie`) are stripped on cross-origin redirects.
- `ssl` passes TLS options to `https.request` (e.g. `{ rejectUnauthorized: false }`).
- `AbortSignal` support is wired through `init.signal` (standard `RequestInit`), aborting the underlying `http.request`.
- Multi-value request headers are preserved as arrays (not flattened by the `Headers` API).
- Body types `ArrayBuffer`, `TypedArray`, and `Blob` are properly converted to `Buffer` before sending.

### `proxyUpgrade` semantics

- Standalone WebSocket upgrade proxy — no `ProxyServer` instance or `EventEmitter` needed.
- `addr` accepts same formats as `proxyFetch`: `http://host:port`, `ws://host:port`, `unix:/path`, or object `{ host, port }` / `{ socketPath }`.
- Validates that the request is a valid WS upgrade (`GET` + `upgrade: websocket`); rejects with error and destroys socket otherwise.
- `xfwd` is enabled by default (unlike `ProxyServer` where it defaults to `false`). Pass `xfwd: false` to disable.
- Supports `xfwd`, `changeOrigin`, `headers`, `ssl`, `secure`, `agent`, `auth`, `prependPath`, `ignorePath`, `toProxy` options via `ProxyUpgradeOptions`.
- Returns `Promise<Socket>` — resolves with the upstream proxy socket on successful upgrade, rejects on connection or socket error.
- If the upstream responds without upgrading (e.g., 404), the response is relayed to the client socket.
- Uses `setupOutgoing()` and `setupSocket()` from shared utils, consistent with `ProxyServer.ws()`.

### Running tests

```bash
pnpm vitest run test/<file>       # Single test file
pnpm vitest run                   # All tests
pnpm test                         # Lint + typecheck + tests with coverage
```

### Test expectations and parity

- The suite includes legacy parity tests ported from `http-party/node-http-proxy` plus project-specific tests (`test/server.test.ts`, `test/fetch.test.ts`, `test/types.test-d.ts`).
- `followRedirects` is natively implemented (no external dependency). See behavioral notes below.
- HTTPS tests rely on local fixtures in `test/fixtures/agent2-*.pem`.

## Key Types

```ts
type ProxyTarget = string | URL | ProxyTargetDetailed;

interface ProxyTargetDetailed {
  host?: string;
  port?: number | string;
  protocol?: string;
  hostname?: string;
  socketPath?: string;
  // TLS: key, passphrase, pfx, cert, ca, ciphers, secureProtocol
}

interface ProxyServerOptions {
  target?: ProxyTarget; // Proxy destination
  forward?: ProxyTarget; // Forward destination
  ws?: boolean; // Enable WebSocket proxying
  xfwd?: boolean; // Add x-forwarded-* headers
  changeOrigin?: boolean; // Rewrite Host header to target
  // ... 30+ more options for paths, headers, cookies, TLS, timeouts
}
```

## Conventions

- ESM only (`"type": "module"`)
- Strict TypeScript with `nodenext` module resolution
- Internal files prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_utils.ts`)
- Tests use `vitest` + `expect.js` assertions
- No production dependencies — Node.js built-ins only
- Semantic commits: `feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, `test:`, `chore:`

## Maintenance

- Keep `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` in sync with the current codebase.
- When you discover new behavior, constraints, architecture details, or workflows, document them in `AGENTS.md` for future agents.
- When implementation or design changes affect user-facing usage or project expectations, update `README.md` in the same change.
- Always add or update automated tests for behavior changes and bug fixes, including regression coverage that would fail without the change.
